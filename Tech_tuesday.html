<p>  The iphone 15 is the newest apple phone  out. It made its debut on September 22nd and has some major upgrades. There are two models. The regular iphone 15 and the iphone 15 plus. There are no differences other than the screen size and battery size. This year has one of the biggest changes in a long time. Apple iphone developers switched the charging port to usb c. Usb C transfers more power making the charge time faster.Battery life is advertised to be able to charge 50% in half an hour now. Now sharing the same charging connector with the majority of devices, transferring files would be easy. Although the iphone 15 screen is the same size -6.7”, the iphone 15 plus now has a much better screen, almost twice as bright oled panel and finally replaces the old notch with the pill-shaped dynamic island. The modern and pro-like  look of the homescreen now that sightly notch is gone. Just like the rest of the iPhones, the iPhone 15 Plus comes in a modest box containing just some user manuals, a SIM ejector tool and a USB-C to USB-C cable for charging. US buyers don't even have the pin for the SIM card tray as these iterations rely only on eSIM.  The design of the new Iphone is more pill shaped with a contoured edge. The phone has an aluminum frame which is supposed to be much stronger than the glass. Some are saying you don’t need a phone case because of how strong it is. The color of the rear glass panel is infused to the material giving it a nice smooth matte finish which is easy to hold. This In some nations, Apple also makes satellite connectivity available on the iPhone 15 for roadside assistance and emergency pings outside of cell range. The latter does after a first two-year grace period demand a subscription. There is also Find My via satellite, allowing you to keep your loved ones informed of your whereabouts even when you are not within range of a cell tower. There are still certain regional restrictions with Emergency SOS and Find My through satellite, though.</p>
  <p> AI or artificial intelligence is human intelligence which is simulated by software heuristics. Artificial intelligence is very common in this era. 2022 has brought AI into the mainstream through generative applications like chatgpt. Almost everyone by now is familiar with chat gpt, especially students. AI is able to replace a lot of tech nowadays and even humans. AI has shown to be able to replace many jobs. Cusotmer service is something AI helps a lot with. It answers questions with quick replies and gathers data from the interweb to give an answer that is best fit. Generative AI also exists. Generative AI is a form of AI that is able to generate text. Not only is it able to generate text, but it is also able to generate images.

    <p> A blockchain is a data structure that allows information to be shared between a business network. A blockchain is made up of many blocks that store information to create a chain. Data is consistent and cannot be modified. This makes blockchains great for tracking orders, payments, accounts, and other transactions.  The challenges of collecting financial transactions using traditional database technologies are diverse. Think about selling an item of land. Ownership of the land goes to the buyer after the exchange of money. While the buyer and seller can each independently record the financial transactions, neither source is reliable. Both the seller and the buyer have the ability to assert that they have not received the money, despite the fact that they have and that they have paid it. A reliable third party must oversee and verify transactions in order to prevent any legal problems. The existence of this organized authority introduces a single point of vulnerability in addition to complicating the transaction. Both parties might be harmed if the central database was breached.  Blockchains function in these following steps. They record the transaction first. The second step is gaining consensus. Once the participants have reached consensus the blocks are linked. The last step is the sharing of ledger.
